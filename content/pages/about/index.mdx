Hi!

My name is Marlin. Writing my first shell script in high school felt like having a superpower. I've been hooked ever since. 
During my career I've worked on more and more complex systems and become increasingly dissatisfied by our inability as software developers to cope with complexity. 
After years as a software practitioner I've discovered my primary motivation is to help developers be better at building better software. 
The conclusion I can't avoid is that we don't need better and better ways to build software, we need a magnitudinal shift. A better better way.
